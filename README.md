In this reposotoiry, you'll find a detailed implmenetation of multicycle processor using Verilog.

First of all, project's [link](https://github.com/amohd63/Multicycle_MIPS/blob/master/Project-2-First-2022_2023.pdf).

The report of our implementation, [here](https://github.com/amohd63/Multicycle_MIPS/blob/master/FinalProjectReport.pdf).

The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/amohd63/Multicycle_MIPS/tree/master/Multicycle_MIPS/Multicycle_MIPS/src)

The testing of all instructions, [here](https://github.com/amohd63/Multicycle_MIPS/tree/master/Testing).
***
For writing boolean expressions and equations, I used these two codes [Equations with 2-bit output](https://github.com/amohd63/Multicycle_MIPS/blob/master/2_bit_truth_table.py), [Equations with 1-bit output](https://github.com/amohd63/Multicycle_MIPS/blob/master/1_bit_truth_table.py).

Otherwise, all .csv files attached are the truth tables which I used with the codes above.
***
You can find online websites for generating the boolean equations, I found [this website](https://www.charlie-coleman.com/experiments/kmap/) very useful.
